## Prop Drilling

In React, data can be passed down from a parent component to a child component using props. This is known as prop drilling. Prop drilling can be cumbersome when you have to pass data through multiple levels of components.

### [Prop Drilling Example](./react-context/with-prop-drilling/src/App.jsx)

## React Context

React Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. Context is designed to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components.

### Using React Context

#### 1. Create a Context along with its Provider

```javascript
// src/contexts/CountContext.jsx

import { createContext } from "react";

const CountContext = createContext();

function CountContextProvider({ children }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    {/* Anything we pass as `value` to `CountContext.Provider` will be accessible by the provider's `children` through the `useContext` hook */}
    <CountContext.Provider value={{ count, setCount }}>
      {children}
    </CountContext.Provider>
  );
}

export { CountContext, CountContextProvider };
```

#### 2. Wrap the components that need access to the Context with the Provider

```javascript
// src/App.jsx

import { CountContextProvider } from "./contexts/CountContext";
import CounterGrandParent from "./components/CounterGrandParent";

function App() {
  return (
    <CountContextProvider>
      {/* we can have many deeply counters that all share the same state */}
      <CounterGrandParent />
      <CounterGrandParent />
      <CounterGrandParent />
    </CountContextProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### 3. Access the Context in the child components

```javascript
// src/components/Counter.jsx

import { useContext } from "react";
import { CountContext } from "../contexts/CountContext";

function Counter() {
  const { count, setCount } = useContext(CountContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((v) => v + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

**Whenver the state of the context changes, all the components that are using the context will re-render.**
