        Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and
        produced by Vince Gilligan for AMC. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New
        Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid,
        dispirited high-school chemistry teacher struggling with a recent
        diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and
        partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce
        and distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future
        before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld.
        Breaking Bad premiered on AMC on January 20, 2008, and concluded on
        September 29, 2013, after five seasons consisting of 62 episodes
